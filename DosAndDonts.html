      <h1>Dos and don'ts of formal writing</h1>
      <h2>Making your writing sound formal</h2>
      <p>It is usually the case that in formal writing you avoid the use of personal pronouns.  These include I, me, we, us and you. However there are instances in certain disciplines where your lecturer will invite you to use the first person. In reflective journal writing for example, using the first person is appropriate.</p>

              <h2>Where to avoid using personal pronouns</h2>
              <p><strong>a. When you are reporting what you did, </strong></p>
              <p> <strong><em>Instead of writing:<br>
                </em></strong> I prepared all the laboratory equipment for the whole group. <br>
                <em><strong>Write:<br>
                </strong></em> The <em>laboratory equipment for the</em> chemistry experiment was prepared.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Instead of writing:<br>
                </em> </strong> I presented the group’s findings to the class. <br>
                <em><strong>Write:<br>
                </strong></em> <em>The group’s findings were presented to the class.</em></p>
              <p><strong>b. When you are referring to what you have said, </strong></p>
              <p> <em><strong>Instead of writing:<br>
                </strong></em> As I have already mentioned, <em>Save the Children</em> are leading the policy discussions on the establishment of Early Childhood Centres.<br>
                <em><strong>Write: <br>
                </strong></em> As previously mentioned, <em>Save the Children</em> are leading the policy discussions on the establishment of Early Childhood Centres.</p>
              <p>In each of these examples, we used the passive voice to make sure that the language sounds impersonal. </p>
              <p><strong>c. When you want to signal that you are drawing a conclusion</strong>, use an impersonal form such as: It can be seen that... </p>
              <p><strong><em>Instead of writing:<br>
                </em> </strong> When using this teaching methodology with children from non-literate homes, y<span class="underline">ou can easily see</span> why it will never be successful.<br>
                <strong><em>Write:</em><br>
                </strong> <em>When using this teaching methodology with children from non-literate homes, <span class="underline">it can easily be seen</span> why it will never be successful.<br>
                </em> </p>
              <p><strong>d. When you want to use evidence to arrive at a conclusion you can also use similar language. For example:</strong></p>
              <p> <em><strong>Instead of writing:<br>
                </strong></em> We can see, after examining the students’ results, that  children are much more likely to be successful in their first two years of school if they have benefitted from preschool activities that promote cognitive growth.<br>
                <em><strong>Write:<br>
                </strong></em> The students’ results show that children are much more likely to be successful in their first two years of school if they have benefitted from preschool activities that promote cognitive growth.</p>

    <h2>What to avoid in formal writing</h2>
    <p>When writing an essay, it is important to construct a reasoned argument that is supported by carefully researched evidence. The language that you use needs to be precise and uncluttered by unnecessary devices which have the potential to distract the reader, shift the meaning or detract from the clarity of the argument.</p>

          <div class="tab-content">
            <h2>Clichés</h2>
            <p>A cliché is an expression that has been overused.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <div class="example">
                <li>We cannot build a new school <strong>at this point in time.</strong></li>
                <li>Who would have thought that slavery      could exist <strong>in this day and age?</strong></li>

        <div class="tab-panel">
          <div class="tab-content">
            <h2>Metaphor</h2>
            <p>A metaphor takes a name or descriptive term and applies it to a person or object in a non-literal sense - for example, <strong>'a glaring error', 'the heart of the matter', 'pillar of the community', 'wave of terrorism'</strong>, and so on.</p>

        <div class="tab-panel">
          <div class="tab-content">
            <h2>Similes</h2>
            <p>A simile compares a person, action or object with something else - for example, '<strong>fly like an eagle', 'solid as a rock', 'as happy as Larry', 'pleased as Punch',</strong> and so on.</p>
            <p>Well-chosen metaphors and similes can give your writing immense expressive power. Once a metaphor or simile has become a cliché, it no longer provides a vivid image for the reader. Consequently, instead of impressing your readers with your writing style, you leave them with the impression that you have nothing of substance to say.</p>

            <h2>Figures of speech</h2>
            <p>Figures of speech are closely related to clichés. Like metaphors and similes, figures of speech provide a writer with a colourful or forceful means to draw attention to a particular point but should be avoided in academic writing.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <li> The cleaners were advised<strong> to lift their game</strong> or else.</li>
                <li> Management has been <strong>on a steep learning curve.</strong></li>

      <div class="tab-panel">
        <div class="tab-content">
          <h2>Colloquialisms and slang</h2>
          <p>Colloquialisms are words or phrases that belong in conversational contexts: </p>
          <div class="example">
            <p>Everybody was wandering around like stunned mullets. (Dazed and confused)</p>
            <p> We'll all be pushing up daisies soon enough. (Dead)</p>
          </div>
          <p> In everyday speech or conversation we often contract words so that what we say does not sound too pompous. E.g. 'can not' (e.g. can't), 'have not' (e.g. haven't), 'is not' (isn't), 'would have' (would've), 'should have' (e.g. should've) and so on. However, in academic writing, colloquial forms should be avoided. </p>
          <p> Some colloquialisms, such as slang expressions or phrases might demean or exclude other language users and must also be avoided. <a href="http://learnline.cdu.edu.au/studyskills/studyskills/inclusivelanguage.html"><span>See inclusive language.</span></a></p>

    <div class="tab-panel">
      <div class="tab-content">
        <h2>Padding</h2>
        <p>Padding consists of all the extra words added to writing that do not add anything to the meaning or content of the text. This includes: </p>
          <li> Redundant phrases such as 'It is interesting/worthy/important to note that ...’ 'For what it's worth ...’.</li>
          <li> Irrelevant material which has no bearing on your topic. </li>
          <li> 'Dead' words includes words which repeat other words e.g. dead corpse, combined together.</li>
          <li> Adverbs add quantity but little to the meaning. Adverbs such as: really, rather, quite, totally and so on, may  not enhance your expression. For example: really obscure, rather tedious. </li>

    <div class="tab-panel">
      <div class="tab-content">
        <h2>Pomposity and pretentiousness</h2>
        <p>Sometimes writers think that by using big, unfamiliar words or complicated sentence structures that this makes their writing sound sophisticated or more important. But it usually just means that no one understands it. For example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>This author concludes that, after due and full consideration, some writers exhibit discursive practices that produce undecipherable sentences, the intelligibility of which beggar even the most sophisticated ratiocinative beings.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p> The sentence could be rewritten in a number of ways:</p>
        <p><strong>Very simply</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
          <p> Some people write so badly that no one understands it.</p>
        </div>
<p><strong>More complex</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
          <p> Some people write in a way that makes it difficult for even quite educated people to understand them.</p>

  <div class="tab-panel">
    <div class="tab-content">
      <h2>Texting language</h2>
      <p>Texting language is the collective term used for the shorthand way that people talk to each other using text messages, email, instant messaging and other forms of written contact. Abbreviating words is common in text language as the examples below show.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> asap - As soon as possible</li>
        <li> atm - At the moment</li>
        <li> b4 - Before</li>
        <li> 	brb - Be right back</li>
        <li> btw - By the way</li>
      </ul>
<p>These example and others are used in informal texting exchanges. It is important to remember that text language is <strong>not acceptable</strong> in formal writing such as essays, exams, reports etcetera.</p>
